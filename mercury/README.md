# Mercury Enclave Server

Key share management in SGX secure enclaves. This system is designed to interact with the mercury server to provide a secure computation and storage system for generating and using shared keys for the mercury layer system. Key secrets are generated in a secure SGX enclave. The SGX-encrypted (secret) and plain (public) parts of the key share proofs are then returned to the non-secure CPU. Once generated, the SGX-encrypted secrets and public proofs are stored in a key-value store database. The secrets/proofs can later be transferred back into the enclave when needed to perform signing operations for statechain transfers.
